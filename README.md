# JCK 6b User's Guide

This repo simply holds a copy of the JCK 6b User's Guide which was once available from the [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net) project under the URL http://openjdk.java.net/groups/conformance/docs/JCK6bUsersGuide/index.html. Unfortunately this resource has been removed and is now only available from the [internet archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20190808200127/http://openjdk.java.net/groups/conformance/docs/JCK6bUsersGuide/index.html).

You may also want to consult the [IcedTea project's](https://icedtea.classpath.org/wiki/Main_Page) [JCK Destilled Wiki page](https://icedtea.classpath.org/wiki/JCKDistilled) which gives a quick overview on how to run a JCK 6 certification. Most of that information is still valid for newer JCK version for which the user's guide isn't publicly available any more.

The OCTLA for Java SE 8 was released in February 2013 and remained at V 2.0 ([20130218_OCTLA-JDK8.pdf](./OCTLA/20130218_OCTLA-JDK8.pdf)). The next OCTLA version V 3.0 was created for Java SE 9 ("*or later, as indicated by Oracle in writing to you*") and released in September 2017 ([20170915_OCTLA-JDK9+.pdf](./OCTLA/20170915_OCTLA-JDK9+.pdf)). Finally, in September 2023, OCTLA version V 4.0 was released for Java SE 21 ("*or later, as indicated by Oracle in writing to you*") ([20230915_OCTLA-JDK21+.pdf](./OCTLA/20230915_OCTLA-JDK21+.pdf)).
