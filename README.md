# JCK 6b User's Guide

This repo simply holds a copy of the JCK 6b User's Guide which was once available from the [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net) project under the URL http://openjdk.java.net/groups/conformance/docs/JCK6bUsersGuide/index.html. Unfortunately this resource has been removed and is now only available from the [internet archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20190808200127/http://openjdk.java.net/groups/conformance/docs/JCK6bUsersGuide/index.html).

You may also want to consult the [IcedTea project's](https://icedtea.classpath.org/wiki/Main_Page) [JCK Destilled Wiki page](https://icedtea.classpath.org/wiki/JCKDistilled) which gives a quick overview on how to run a JCK 6 certification. Most of that information is still valid for newer JCK version for which the user's guide isn't publicly available any more.
